# Procar Parser
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)


This is a small Python script for parsing data from PROCAR files generated by VASP, and then store it in output files.

### Usage
You can execute the script by,

```Bash
python procar_parse.py <path/to/PROCAR file>
```
Make sure the PROCAR file you have is of the same format as the sample PROCAR file in the repository.

Example: If you have your PROCAR file in the same directory as the program,Then you can execute the following command,
```Bash 
python procar_parse.py PROCAR
```

### Generated Output
The output will be stored in the Output Folder generated after the program has finished running. Each Ion will be having a
seperate folder with each folder containing text files. Each text file will be for one of the bands and it will include all the the Energy values of various orbitals.
along all k-points.

Consider a PROCAR file for 2 Ions with 8 bands each along 90 Kpoints, Then the structure of Output directory will be,
```
Output
└───Ion1
    │-band_1.txt
    │-band_2.txt
    │-band_3.txt
    │-band_4.txt
    │-band_5.txt
    │-band_6.txt
    │-band_7.txt
    │-band_8.txt
    │
└───Ion2
    │-band_1.txt
    │-band_2.txt
    │-band_3.txt
    │-band_4.txt
    │-band_5.txt
    │-band_6.txt
    │-band_7.txt
    │-band_8.txt
```

Each band files will contain the orbital energies for all the k-points in the PROCAR file.
